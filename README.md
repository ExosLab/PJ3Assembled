# PJ3Assembled
Planet Jam 3 -- the sequel Planet Jam 2 and threequel to Week World Planet Jam, a collaboration between 14 modders to make a large planetary system.

# REQUIREMENTS:
* Kopernicus v141 or later (and its prerequisites). https://github.com/Kopernicus/Kopernicus/releases/
* Niako's Mitchell-Netravali Filtered Heightmap: https://github.com/pkmniako/Kopernicus_VertexMitchellNetravaliHeightMap/releases
* Kopernicus Expansions Continued-er: https://github.com/VabienArt/KopernicusExpansion-Continueder/releases
* Scatterer: https://github.com/LGhassen/Scatterer/releases/
* Environmental Visual Enhancements Redux: https://github.com/LGhassen/EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements/releases/

Yes, Scatterer and EVE are *REQUIRED*. They are not merely supported, they are required for the mod to work. <-- this was the policy for PJ2 because Scatter makes multistar lighting look actually good, I kept this in because we do indeed still have more than one star but like, I won't tell anyone if you decide not to use visual mods, you know?
