				InSpaceHigh = While the visage of Antether itself remains shrouded in a broad disk and a blinding light, a primal instinct urges all to remain in the safety of the cabin and avert their gaze, lest whatever lies below take root.
				
				InSpaceLow = We are truly entering the thick of it now. The vast scale of this cosmic whirlpool is made apparent, and the luminous core is nearly impossible to look at. A threatening heat can be felt emanating from every window.
				InSpaceLow = There is a distinct feeling that our frail vessel is not welcome here, and we are intruders upon this land. But we must discover what lurks here, for science and adventure.

				InSpaceHigh = The eye beckons. The eye has an offer to make. We must only approach it closer.
				
				InSpaceLow = This is not a safe place to be. You feel like the thin currents of matter will wash you away to a fiery end. Perhaps it would be prudent to return to safety quickly.
				InSpaceLow = This is not a safe place to be. You feel like the thin currents of matter will wash you away to a fiery end. Perhaps it would be prudent to return to safety quickly.
				InSpaceLow = A tugging can be felt in the back of your mind, like cosmic tentacles taking hold. It offers a reward of great speed, should you take a dive into the very heart of the searing light, which threatens to immolate all that enter.
				
				
				
				SrfLanded = The gravity here should crush you to an atom-thick paste, and yet it hasn't. The kraken has saved us, let us pray that it does not change its mind.	//Impossible to get normally

				InSpaceHigh = The heat of Antether overwhelms that of all other sources, effectively the system's fourth star. Readings place the habitable zone such that Exakra Din is in its outer reaches, and the innermost worlds are likely to be under scorching heat.
				InSpaceHigh = Temperatures are climbing rapidly with proximity to this object. Caution is advised for any close approaches, which must endure an intense heat. On the other hand, this adds yet another habitable-zone world to the system further out.
				
				InSpaceLow = Thermometer readings are in: accretion disks are very hot.
				InSpaceLow = Skyrocketing temperatures indicate that is getting dangerous. Care must be taken to avoid overheating sensitive equipment.
				
				
				
				SrfLanded = At 7602 kelvins, the surface temperatures should vaporize everything but the nigh-indestructible crust of Antether. We exist only because we are allowed to.	//Impossible to get normally

				SrfLanded = Suddenly, the goo speaks with a voice existing seemingly at all levels at once, in a language lost to time and yet understood by all. To listen is to invite madness, or so the legends go.	//Impossible to get normally

				InSpaceHigh = Gravitational dynamics in the Antether system are complex, but are dominated by an apparent point source in the center. Whatever it is, it must be unbelievably dense. Closer investigation is warranted.
				InSpaceHigh = While this vantage is too far to resolve the dense core of the system, the effects of the worlds orbiting it can readily be seen on the detector.
				
				InSpaceLow = From this closer position, Antether can finally be measured. This object has a density so great that the only hypothetical substance that fits the bill is QCD matter, making Antether some kind of miniature quark star. Perhaps it's a fragment of one?

This object has a density so great that the only hypothetical substance that fits the bill is QCD matter, making Antether some kind of miniature quark star. A fleeting glimpse of something seemingly residing on its surface is picked up on as well before vanishing, but surely nothing can withstand the gravity there?
				
				
				
				SrfLanded = The gravity here is immense. Anything and everything is crushed flat, except, somehow, for the detector. The signature of intricately structured cosmic strings are detected as well.	//Imposible to get normally

				InSpaceHigh = The material bay's onboard computer appears to need constant resetting, and frequent manual overrides, as it seems to constantly be scrambled by the environment here. Antether is not kind to the mechanical, it would seem.
				
				InSpaceLow = In addition to the typical effects of the heat, radiation, and near-vacuum environment, every now and then one of the more sensitive samples will seemingly undergo a chemical reaction that can't be explained with any elements known to exist in nature, or even be remotely stable at all. Is this a detector glitch, or something more?

			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Antether's magnetosphere is intense, exerting a massive influence. The field sweeps over the craft with unfathomably high, seemingly superluminal, velocities, causing all sorts of electromagnetic chaos.
				
				InSpaceLow = The magnetic field, its rotation a blur that repeats itself in mere milliseconds, is massively powerful here. Cusps in the field point towards extremely exotic happenings deeper within, including virtual currents that behave as though they're driven beyond the speed of light, and possibly even magnetic monopoles on or maybe within Antether itself.
				
				
				
				SrfLanded = At the surface, the magnetic field strength is so strong it threatens to disable the fundamental chemistry of life and tear apart anything and everything less than Antether itself. We are protected, for now. Magnetic monopoles appear to be present as well, threaded in complex, mobile structures.	//Impossible to get normally
