				InSpaceHigh = The world below looks impossible, but it is there all the same. It beckons us to learn its mysteries.
				InSpaceHigh = That a celestial body can survive so long embedded in an accretion disk so close to something so massive beggars belief. We should investigate this object closer.
				
				InSpaceLow = The blade-like terrain below looks imposing, and appears difficult to land on, particularly with the surprisingly high gravity your orbital speed suggests. Hopefully the landing gear are up to the task.
				InSpaceLow = With how steep and omnipresent the mountains seem to be, you wonder if it would be better to do a landing in whatever fills those apparent seas. It might be dangerous, but so are cliffs.
				
				FlyingHigh = The forces pushing back on your vehicle are changing at a surprising rate, just how quickly does this atmosphere gain density?
				FlyingHigh = Being able to see so much of the world's curvature from inside the atmosphere is quite the unusual sight, but a quick look up reminds you that unusual is to be expected here.
				
				FlyingLow = You could almost think this was a normal planet, but the massive debris disk arcing across the sky and proximity of the horizon tell a very different story.
				FlyingLowCliffs = The enormous wall nearby demands all your attention, and definitely is not a good place to land.
				FlyingLowSlopes = While still far from flat, this small region of ground might be as good a patch of solid ground for landing as can be found on Rachess.
				FlyingLowSeas = A splashdown may be feasible, but there'd be nowhere to plant a flag, and there's no way that could be water we're flying over now.
				
				SrfSplashed = The ship floats here so well, it almost seems to be landed on solid ground. The lack of any significant waves further reinforces this illusion.
				SrfLandedCliffs = Well, this is quite a predicament.
				SrfLandedRidges = Well, this is quite a predicament.
				SrfLandedSlopes = There may be nowhere better to land, but this still isn't the most stable of landing sites. Hopefully the landing gear are capable enough.
				SrfLandedPlateaus = There may be nowhere better to land, but this still isn't the most stable of landing sites. Hopefully the landing gear are capable enough.
				SrfLandedPeaks = From up here, the shape of this tiny world is quite apparent, as is the compactness of its atmosphere - we seem to be above most of it.

				InSpaceHigh = A spacewalk makes you feel incredibly exposed, and simultaneously awestruck by the spectacle you are immersed in.
				InSpaceHigh = It can see you... this place is not sanctuary... turn back before it is too late...
				InSpaceLow = A world of blades below, a whirlpool of flame above. Outside doesn't feel the safest, but it is quite the place to be.
				
				
				SrfSplashed = You feel extremely buoyant in this sea, to the point that it actually becomes difficult to move. You also feel extremely hot, and get the impression it is not a safe place for a swim. Probably not good to drink either.

			{
				SrfSplashed = Chemical analysis reveals the seas to be comprised primarily of liquid plutonium, with various other actinides and some halides mixed in. Strangely, however, it is not radioactive at all, and is slightly too dense. Could this be a natural example of stable hypernuclei?
				SrfLandedSlopes = The surface is coated in organometallic compounds, primarily ferrocene, though strangely seeming to contain a heavy isotope of iron that should be unstable. A deeper core sample, requiring a diamond-edged bit to extract, seems to reveal apparent hassium compounds, all of which slightly heavier than expected, and none of which radioactive, somehow. It appears that whatever is stabilizing these atoms is also making them heavier, perhaps as a result of exotic particles contained within.
				SrfLandedPlateaus = The surface has a thin coating of organometallic compounds, primarily ferrocene, though strangely seeming to contain a heavy isotope of iron that should be unstable. A deeper core sample, requiring a diamond-edged bit to extract, seems to reveal hassium and compounds thereof, all of which slightly heavier than expected, and none of which radioactive, somehow. It appears that whatever is stabilizing these atoms is also making them heavier, perhaps as a result of exotic particles contained within.
				SrfLandedCliffs = Traces of organometal powders, such as ferrocene, cling to the cliffsides. Primarily, however, they are bare, revealing a thick layer of metal halides. However, they are extremely heavy, and appear to predominately feature hassium, which should be highly unstable. What's more, the halogens involved seem to be predominately heavy isotopes of astatine and tennesine, and yet no radioactive decay is detected.
				SrfLandedRidges = Traces of organometal powders, such as ferrocene, cling to the cliffsides. Primarily, however, they are bare, revealing a composition of metal halides with pockets of pure metal. However, they are extremely heavy, and appear to predominately feature hassium, which should be highly unstable. What's more, the halogens involved seem to be predominately heavy isotopes of astatine and tennesine, and yet no radioactive decay is detected.
				SrfLandedPeaks = At these altitudes, the powdery regolith is mostly fallen to lower elevations, and the thin atmosphere only minimally reacts with the surface. A core sample reveals a composition of nearly pure hassium, with a thin surface layer of heavy hassium halides in spots. How these elements could possibly exist here, let alone in bulk, beggars belief, but the incredible density of hassium does at least seem to explain that of Rachess on the whole.

			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = The heat here is approaching dangerous levels, but is not significantly more than would be expected given the light cast upon the craft.
				
				InSpaceLow = A slight temperature anomaly is registered, indicating a source of heat in the world below, suggesting some degree of active tidal heating at play.
				
				FlyingHigh = The upper atmosphere is already above boiling, and increases further with depth. If Rachess has a thermosphere, it is too thin for the instrument to accurately measure the temperature of.
				
				FlyingLow = The temperature continues to rise with depth with no stopping, showing that Rachess does not posess a stratosphere, rather shifting directly from troposphere to mesosphere. In addition, there must be some significant greenhouse effect or internal heat source to account for the temperature.
				
				SrfSplashed = The oceans are very hot, nearly enough to be incandescent. They also have a high thermal conductivity consistent with a molten metal. However, they aren't any hotter than the surrounding terrain, and not much hotter than the atmosphere, implying that they are not volcanic in origin, but rather something analogous to a more traditional sea.
				SrfLanded = The ground appears to be hotter than the atmosphere, confirming that the heat is coming from within. What's more, it appears to have an extremely high thermal conductivity. It also seems to have a high melting point, as it doesn't seem to even be softened by the heat.
				SrfLandedPlateaus = The ground appears to be hotter than the atmosphere, confirming that the heat is coming from within. What's more, it appears to have an extremely high thermal conductivity.
				SrfLandedRidges = The ground appears to be hotter than the atmosphere, confirming that the heat is coming from within. What's more, it appears to have an extremely high thermal conductivity.

				InSpaceHigh = The goo recoils, shrinking away from Antether's light. It seems to be some sort of primal instinct or fear response - the goo does not want to be here.
				
				InSpaceLow = Upon opening the container, a loud hissing can be heard, and a strange steam is released. Some combination of factors appears to have vaporized the goo, but when you reseal the container, the detector claims it has returned.
				
				Flying = The wind starts whipping bits of the goo out. Strange, it doesn't seem like the atmosphere should have so much effect already...
				
				
				SrfSplashed = The goo escapes into the sea, but doesn't sink. Instead it just pools on the surface, seemingly disappointed at its immiscibility. It is easily recovered, though some of the metallic substance got scooped up with it.
				
				SrfLanded = The goo slowly bubbles, but doesn't do much else. An overall underwhelming reaction.

				InSpaceHigh = The barometer just barely picks up on the thin dusty gas that comprises the accretion disk and forms a sort of "atmosphere" above and below, as well as something akin to a solar wind.
				
				InSpaceLow = The tiny planet's atmospehere appears to continue to very high altitudes compared to its radius, and must interact directly with the stellar wind and accretion disk. Most likely it is being consistently lost and replaced by thesse interactions.
				
				FlyingHigh = As the readout slowly rises, you wonder how there's so much atmosphere on a world so small.
				
				FlyingLow = While still much higher than it seems to have any right to be, the surface pressure still reads strangely low, considering the density felt by the craft's motion through it.

				InSpaceLow = The composition of the world is pretty uniform overall. While not undifferentiated, there seems to be only a single primary constituent material comprising most of its mass, with only a tiny core of even more unexplainably dense material underneath.

				InSpaceHigh = In addition to the typical effects of the heat, radiation, and near-vacuum environment, every now and then one of the more sensitive samples will seemingly undergo a chemical reaction that can't be explained with any elements known to exist in nature, or even be remotely stable at all. Is this a detector glitch, or something more?
				
				InSpaceLow = The materials already seem to be reacting with trace reactive species from the faint outer wisps of atmosphere. Most of said reactions are still quite unusual, though, following impossible-seeming pathways and resulting in strangely heavy substances.
				
				FlyingHigh = As the apparatus is exposed to ever-denser atmosphere, the reactions not only become more pronounced, but also more regular, until the great majority all of them seem to involve a single compound. This implies the atmosphere does not contain a very diverse array of gases. What it does contain, however, seems to barely even be on the periodic table based on these products.
				
				FlyingLow = In addition to the exotic reactions dominating here, some tests for plutonium seem to be being set off. It's infrequent enough to likely be a fluke, however, since there's no observable radiation here.
				
				
				SrfSplashed = Some of the metallic-looking sea splashes in, and it becomes clear that this is no normal ocean - based on the variety of chemical reactions induced, it's made out of pure molten plutonium, and somehow with no radiation at all.
				
				SrfLanded = As the apparatus is exposed to ever-denser atmosphere, the reactions not only become more pronounced, but also more regular, until the great majority all of them seem to involve a single compound.

				FlyingHigh = The atmosphere appears to be primarily oganesson tetratenneside, with small quantities of molecular oganesson. Strangely, the molecular weight is slightly higher than the already quite high expected values. This does help explain how such a small world can retain an atmosphere, however.
				
				FlyingLow = From lower altitudes, precision measurements can be made, revealing a composition of 95.3% oganesson tetratenneside, and 4.7% molecular oganesson, along with a high molecular weight of 1619.89 grams per mole. What has not been revealed, however, is the presence of any kind of decay product, as though these superheavy elements were actually stable.
				
				FlyingHighPeaks = The atmosphere appears to be primarily oganesson tetratenneside, with small quantities of various other oxides of both oganesson and hassium, as well as traces of molecular oganesson. The ratio shifts away from molecular oganesson near the peaks, suggesting some chemical weathering at play there consuming it.
			
				FlyingLowSeas =  From lower altitudes, precision measurements can be made, revealing a composition of 95.3% oganesson tetratenneside, and 4.7% molecular oganesson, along with a high molecular weight of 1619.89 grams per mole. Very faint traces of plutonium humidity are also present, though due to the extremely low vapor pressure of plutonium these are barely detectable. What has not been revealed, however, is the presence of any kind of decay product, as though these superheavy elements were actually stable.
